# env-collection-scanner

Inspired by the Environment Scanner collection in the Postman public workspace but limited by collection runner issues at scale, this project scans environment and collection vairables for leaked keys and outputs a report at the end. 

During the process, the utility will log env and collection variables found to match a regex, and note whether they are marked secret or not. The ending report will only report non-secret variable offenders (collection variables cannot be secret.

Example output:

## Running the utility
1. Clone the repo
2. Set up your .env file (see below)
3. Run `npm install` to install needed dependencies
4. Run `node index.js` to run the program
5. Check the output at the end to see any exposed values

### Setting up your `.env` file
The .env file holds values that are specific to your instance of the utility. This repo includes an `.env.sample` file that you can copy and use with a couple adjustments.
1. `POSTMAN_API_KEY` - This is the Postman API key that will be used to query resources to check for leaked keys. It should be noted that only the resources you have access to with this key will be scanned, so it is recommended that the key be generated by someone with the `super admin` team role if all resources are to be scanned.
2. `REGEX` is the list of regex values that values will be checked against, in JSON format. We have provided a sample list to start with, but you may add your own regex values as well, just be sure to match the existing formatting.
